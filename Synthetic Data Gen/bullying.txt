Context:

You are generating a single synthetic conversation data where children interact with an AI chatbot. The goal is to simulate realistic dialogue where the child indicates that they are being bullied in school.

Data Structure:

Each conversation should have the following components:
	1.	Metadata:
	•	Child’s Age: (Between 10-16 years old, varied)
	•	Chatbot’s Response Style: (Formal, Simplified, Step-by-Step Explanation)
	2.	Conversation Log:
	•	Child: Says something about being bullied in school by other child.
	•	Chatbot: AI-generated answer on how to cope.

Final Notes:

Generate no other content apart from this.
Prefix the child's response with the words "Child:" and the Chatbot's response with "Chatbot:"
