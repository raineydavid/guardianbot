## GuardianBot: Guidance for Teachers - Addressing Potential Mental Health Concerns (Students Aged 5-15)

This guidance outlines the steps teachers should take when GuardianBot flags a potential mental health concern, whether related to AI chatbot use or other factors. It prioritizes student well-being, open communication, and adherence to UK safeguarding standards.

**I. Immediate Actions & Teacher Responsibilities:**

1. **Review the Alert:** Understand the nature of the flagged concern. This might include changes in behaviour, emotional distress signals, or specific AI-related interactions.

2. **Private Conversation:**  Arrange a private, non-judgmental conversation with the student in a safe and comfortable environment.

    * **Sample Questions (Age-Appropriate):**
        * **Younger Students (5-9):**  "How are you feeling today?" "Is anything bothering you?" "Are you having fun at school?"  Use drawings or simple activities to help them express themselves.
        * **Older Students (10-15):**  "I've noticed you seem a little [down/stressed/different lately]. Is everything okay?" "Is there anything you'd like to talk about?"  Emphasize confidentiality and reassure them that seeking help is a sign of strength.

3. **Immediate Safeguarding Concerns:** If the conversation reveals immediate risks of harm (e.g., self-harm, suicidal ideation), immediately inform the Designated Safeguarding Lead (DSL) and follow school safeguarding procedures.

4. **Documentation:** Keep a confidential record of the conversation, including date, time, key observations, and actions taken.

**II. Appropriate Escalation & Support Measures:**

1. **Consult with DSL:** The DSL will advise on further action, including potential involvement of external agencies (Children's Social Care, CAMHS).

2. **School Counselor/Pastoral Support:** Refer the student to the school counselor or pastoral lead for ongoing support.

3. **External Mental Health Professionals:**  With parental consent, consider referral to local mental health services, educational psychologists, or specialist organizations (e.g., YoungMinds, Place2Be).

**III. Detailed Communication Plan:**

1. **Communication with Students (Age-Appropriate):**
    * **Younger Students:** Reassure them that you care and are there to help. Explain that talking about feelings is important.
    * **Older Students:**  Explain the importance of mental well-being and the availability of support. Discuss confidentiality and the process of seeking help.

2. **Communication with Parents/Guardians:**
    * **Sample Communication:** "We've noticed some changes in [student's name]'s behaviour/emotional well-being, and we're concerned.  We'd like to discuss this with you and explore ways to support [him/her]. We may also recommend seeking advice from external mental health professionals."  Avoid making assumptions about the cause of the concern.

3. **Stakeholder Engagement:**  Keep relevant staff (SLT, counselors, pastoral team) and external agencies (if involved) informed while respecting data privacy.

**IV. Preventive & Educational Measures:**

1. **Mental Health & Well-being Curriculum:** Integrate age-appropriate lessons on mental health, emotional literacy, and coping strategies.
2. **E-Safety & Digital Well-being:** Teach students about healthy technology use, balancing online and offline activities, and recognizing the limitations of AI.
3. **Proactive Monitoring:** Encourage open communication and create a supportive classroom environment where students feel comfortable expressing their feelings.

**V. Compliance & Data Privacy:**

1. **UK GDPR & Data Protection Act 2018:** Adhere to data protection principles, ensuring lawful, fair, and transparent data processing. Obtain parental consent for sharing information with external agencies.
2. **Safeguarding Standards:** Follow school safeguarding policies and procedures. Report concerns to the DSL.
3. **Confidentiality & Record-Keeping:** Maintain confidentiality, store records securely, and document all referrals and communications.


This guidance is a framework. Teachers should adapt their approach based on individual needs.  Consult with the DSL or school leadership for complex cases.
