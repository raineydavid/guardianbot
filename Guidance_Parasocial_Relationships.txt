## GuardianBot: Guidance for Teachers - Addressing Potential Parasocial Relationships with AI Chatbots (Students Aged 5-15)

This guidance outlines the steps teachers should take when GuardianBot flags a potential parasocial relationship between a student and an AI chatbot.  It prioritizes student well-being, open communication, and adherence to UK safeguarding standards.

**I. Immediate Actions & Teacher Responsibilities:**

1. **Review the Alert:** Understand the nature of the flagged interaction. Consider the frequency, duration, and emotional content of the student's communication with the chatbot.

2. **Private Conversation:** Arrange a private, non-judgmental conversation with the student.

    * **Sample Questions (Age-Appropriate):**
        * **Younger Students (5-9):** "Who are your favourite people to talk to? Do you talk to anyone online?  What do you like to talk about with them?"
        * **Older Students (10-15):** "I've noticed you've been spending time talking with [chatbot name]. Can you tell me a bit about that?" "How do these online conversations make you feel?"

3. **Safeguarding Concerns:** If the conversation reveals potential harm (e.g., emotional distress, vulnerability, inappropriate content), immediately inform the Designated Safeguarding Lead (DSL).

4. **Documentation:** Keep a confidential record of the conversation, including date, time, key observations, and any actions taken.

**II. Appropriate Escalation & Support Measures:**

1. **Consult with DSL:**  The DSL will advise on further action, including potential involvement of external agencies (if necessary).

2. **School Counselor Referral:** If the student exhibits emotional distress or social difficulties, refer them to the school counselor for support.

3. **Pastoral Support:**  Inform the student's Head of Year/Pastoral Lead to ensure a coordinated approach to supporting the student's well-being.

**III. Detailed Communication Plan:**

1. **Communication with Students (Age-Appropriate):**
    * **Younger Students:** Focus on healthy friendships, emphasizing the importance of talking to trusted adults and real-life friends.
    * **Older Students:** Discuss the nature of online relationships, the limitations of AI, and the importance of balanced social interactions. Explain that chatbots cannot replace human connection.

2. **Communication with Parents/Guardians:**
    * **Sample Communication:** "We've noticed [student's name] has developed a close interaction with an AI chatbot.  We want to work with you to ensure [he/she] understands the difference between online interactions and real-life relationships and maintains a healthy social balance.  We encourage you to have conversations at home about online safety and healthy relationships.”
    * Discuss observed behaviours, potential risks, and strategies for supporting the student at home.

3. **Stakeholder Engagement:** Keep relevant staff (SLT, pastoral team) informed, respecting data privacy.

**IV. Preventive & Educational Measures:**

1. **Digital Literacy Curriculum:** Integrate lessons on healthy online relationships, AI limitations, and responsible technology use.
2. **E-Safety Assemblies/Workshops:**  Educate students on online safety, including the risks of over-reliance on online interactions.
3. **Parent Information Sessions:**  Offer sessions for parents on supporting children's online safety and fostering healthy social development.

**V.  Compliance & Data Privacy:**

1. **UK GDPR & Data Protection Act 2018:** Adhere to data protection principles, ensuring data is processed lawfully, fairly, and transparently.
2. **Safeguarding Standards:**  Follow school safeguarding policies and procedures, reporting any concerns to the DSL.
3. **Confidentiality:**  Maintain confidentiality and share information only with relevant staff on a need-to-know basis. Securely store all records related to the case.


This guidance offers a framework. Teachers should adapt their approach based on individual circumstances. Consult with the DSL or school leadership for complex cases or further guidance.
