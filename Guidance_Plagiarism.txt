## GuardianBot:  Guidance for Teachers - Addressing AI-Assisted Plagiarism (Students Aged 5-15)

This guidance outlines the steps teachers should take when GuardianBot flags potential AI-assisted plagiarism.  It emphasizes educational interventions and open communication with students and parents.

**I. Initial Steps (Post-Flagging by GuardianBot):**

1. **Verify the Flag:** Review the flagged work alongside the student's previous submissions and classroom performance. Look for inconsistencies in style, vocabulary, or understanding.  Do not assume the flag automatically equates to plagiarism.

2. **Private Conversation with the Student:** Arrange a private and non-confrontational meeting with the student.  The aim is to understand *how* the work was completed, not to accuse.

    * **Sample Questions (Age-Appropriate):**
        * "Can you tell me about how you researched and wrote this assignment?"
        * "This section seems different from your usual writing. Can you explain your process here?"
        * (For younger students) "Did you get any help with this homework?"

3. **Gather Information:**  Determine if the student used an AI chatbot:
    * If they admit to using AI:  Proceed to Step 4.
    * If they deny using AI but you remain suspicious after further investigation:  Document your concerns and consult with your Head of Department/Year.  Do *not* directly accuse the student without clear evidence.

**II.  Addressing AI Use & Educating the Student:**

4. **Explain Academic Integrity:** Regardless of admission, use this opportunity to educate the student about plagiarism and appropriate research practices.  Explain why using AI chatbots to complete assignments undermines learning and academic integrity.

    * **Key Concepts (Age-Appropriate):**
        * Owning your work.
        * The value of learning and developing skills.
        * Citing sources and acknowledging help.

5. **Consequences & Restorative Approach:** Explain the school's policy on plagiarism (e.g., rewriting the assignment, reduced grade).  Emphasize a restorative approach focused on learning from the mistake and developing good academic practices.

**III. Communicating with Parents:**

6. **Inform Parents:** Contact parents/guardians to explain the situation. Focus on the school's commitment to academic integrity and supporting the student's learning. Avoid accusatory language.

    * **Sample Communication:** "We've noticed [student's name] may have used an AI tool inappropriately for their [subject] assignment. We're working with [him/her] to understand proper research methods and ensure future work meets our academic integrity standards."

7. **Joint Discussion (if necessary):**  If the situation is complex or recurring,  arrange a meeting with the student, parents, and teacher to discuss strategies for supporting the student's learning and responsible technology use.


**IV.  Prevention and Education:**

* **Curriculum Integration:** Incorporate lessons on digital literacy, ethical AI use, and academic integrity into the curriculum across all subjects.
* **Parent Workshops:** Offer workshops to educate parents about AI tools, their potential misuse, and strategies for supporting responsible technology use at home.
* **Clear School Policy:**  Ensure the school's Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) explicitly addresses AI chatbot usage for academic work.  Make the policy accessible to students and parents.

**V. Data Privacy Considerations:**

* All discussions and actions regarding suspected AI plagiarism must adhere to the UK GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018.
* Ensure appropriate data security measures are in place within GuardianBot and related systems.
* Only collect and process data necessary for addressing academic integrity concerns.

This guidance is designed to be a supportive framework. Teachers should adapt their approach based on the individual student's age, maturity level, and specific circumstances.  Consult with school leadership for complex cases or further guidance.
