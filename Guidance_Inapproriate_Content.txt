## GuardianBot: Guidance for Teachers - Addressing Inappropriate Content in AI Chatbot Interactions (Students Aged 5-15)

This guidance outlines the steps teachers should take when GuardianBot flags inappropriate content in a student's AI chatbot interactions.  It prioritizes student safety, open communication, and adherence to UK safeguarding standards.

**I. Immediate Actions & Teacher Responsibilities:**

1. **Review Flagged Content:** Carefully assess the nature and severity of the inappropriate content (language, topics, media).

2. **Initial Conversation (Age-Appropriate):** Arrange a private, non-confrontational conversation with the student.

    * **Sample Questions:**
        * **Younger Students (5-9):**  "Can you tell me about what you were talking about with the chatbot?" "Are there any words or pictures you saw that made you feel uncomfortable?"
        * **Older Students (10-15):** "I've noticed some concerning content in your recent chatbot interactions.  Can you help me understand what was happening?"  Emphasize that you are there to support them.

3. **Document the Incident:** Keep a confidential, factual record of the conversation, including the date, time, nature of the content, and the student's response.  Do not include personal opinions or assumptions.

**II. Appropriate Escalation & Support Measures:**

1. **Inform Designated Safeguarding Lead (DSL):**  Immediately inform the DSL if the content involves illegal activity (e.g., child sexual exploitation, extremist material),  poses a risk of harm to the student or others, or if you have any safeguarding concerns.

2. **Counselor Referral:** If the student displays emotional distress, anxiety, or other related concerns, refer them to the school counselor for support.

3. **Senior Leadership Involvement:** Inform senior leadership as per school safeguarding procedures.

**III. Detailed Communication Plan:**

1. **Communication with Students (Age-Appropriate):**
    * **Younger Students:** Explain in simple terms why the content is inappropriate, relating it to school rules about kindness, respect, and safety.
    * **Older Students:** Discuss the potential risks and consequences of engaging with inappropriate content online, emphasizing digital citizenship, online reputation, and legal implications.

2. **Communication with Parents/Guardians:**
    * **Sample Communication:** "We've identified some concerning content in [student's name]'s interactions with an AI chatbot. We want to work with you to address this and ensure [he/she] understands safe and responsible online behaviour.  We encourage you to have a conversation at home about online safety."  Avoid judgmental language.

3. **Stakeholder Engagement:** Keep relevant staff (DSL, counselors, senior leadership) and any external agencies (if required by law) informed while respecting confidentiality.

**IV. Preventive & Educational Measures:**

1. **Digital Literacy & Online Safety Curriculum:** Integrate lessons on responsible online behaviour, critical thinking, media literacy, recognizing and reporting inappropriate content, and seeking help when needed.

2. **E-Safety Assemblies/Workshops:**  Reinforce school values related to respect, online safety, and responsible digital citizenship.

3. **Parent Information Sessions:** Provide parents with resources and guidance on monitoring children's online activities, setting boundaries, and discussing online safety.

**V. Compliance & Data Privacy:**

1. **UK GDPR & Data Protection Act 2018:** Adhere to data protection principles. Ensure data is processed lawfully, fairly, and transparently. Obtain parental consent before sharing information with external agencies (unless legal obligations override this).

2. **Safeguarding Standards:**  Strictly follow school safeguarding policies and procedures, reporting any concerns to the DSL.

3. **Confidentiality & Data Security:**  Store all flagged content and related records securely and confidentially, restricting access to authorized personnel only.  Follow school procedures for handling sensitive information.


This guidance provides a framework.  Teachers should adapt their approach based on the specific context. Consult with the DSL or school leadership for complex cases or further guidance.
