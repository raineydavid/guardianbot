## GuardianBot: Guidance for Teachers - Addressing Excessive AI Chatbot Use (Students Aged 5-15)

This guidance outlines the steps teachers should take when GuardianBot flags excessive AI chatbot use by a student.  It emphasizes student well-being, open communication, and a balanced approach to technology.

**I. Immediate Actions & Teacher Responsibilities:**

1. **Review the Alert:** Understand the extent of the flagged usage (frequency, duration). Consider the times of day the chatbot is being accessed.

2. **Informal Check-in:** Initiate a casual conversation with the student.

    * **Sample Questions (Age-Appropriate):**
        * **Younger Students (5-9):** "What games or activities do you enjoy online?" "Do you spend time talking to any computer friends?"
        * **Older Students (10-15):** "I've noticed you've been spending time chatting with [chatbot name]. What do you enjoy about it?" "How does it fit in with your other activities?"

3. **Document Initial Observations:** Note any changes in the student's behaviour, academic performance, or social interactions.

**II. Appropriate Escalation & Support Measures:**

1. **Further Investigation:** If the informal conversation suggests excessive use or negative impacts, schedule a more formal meeting with the student. Explore potential underlying reasons for the excessive chatbot use.

2. **Involve Pastoral Support:** Inform the student’s Head of Year/Pastoral Lead to ensure a coordinated approach to supporting the student's well-being.

3. **Counselor Referral (If Necessary):** If the student exhibits emotional distress, social withdrawal, or other concerns, consider referral to the school counselor.

**III. Detailed Communication Plan:**

1. **Communication with Students (Age-Appropriate):**
    * **Younger Students:** Discuss healthy online habits, the importance of balancing screen time with other activities, and the value of face-to-face interactions. Use visual aids or stories.
    * **Older Students:**  Discuss time management, responsible technology use, and the potential impact of excessive screen time on academic performance, sleep, and social life.

2. **Communication with Parents/Guardians:**
    * **Sample Communication:** "We've noticed [student's name] is spending a significant amount of time interacting with an AI chatbot.  We'd like to discuss this with you and explore strategies for ensuring a healthy balance of online and offline activities at home and school." Share resources on managing screen time and promoting healthy technology use.

3. **Stakeholder Engagement:** Keep relevant staff (SLT, counselors, pastoral team) informed, ensuring a consistent and supportive message across the school.

**IV. Preventive & Educational Measures:**

1. **Digital Wellbeing Curriculum:**  Integrate lessons on healthy technology use, time management, online safety, and the importance of balanced activities.

2. **E-Safety Assemblies/Workshops:** Educate students about responsible AI use, the limitations of chatbots, and the benefits of real-world social interactions.

3. **Parent Information Sessions:** Offer guidance to parents on setting healthy screen time limits, promoting balanced technology use, and fostering open communication about online activities.


**V. Compliance & Data Privacy:**

1. **UK GDPR & Data Protection Act 2018:** Adhere to data protection principles. Ensure data is processed lawfully, transparently, and with appropriate safeguards.

2. **Safeguarding Standards:** Follow school safeguarding policies and procedures. Any concerns about student welfare should be escalated to the DSL.

3. **Confidentiality & Data Security:** Store all records related to excessive chatbot use securely and confidentially. Access should be limited to relevant staff on a need-to-know basis.


This guidance is a framework. Teachers should adapt their approach based on individual student needs and circumstances. Consult with the DSL or school leadership for complex cases or further guidance.
