        Relationships with AI Chatbots (Students Aged 5-15)
      </h1>
      <p className="mb-4">
        This guidance outlines the steps teachers should take when GuardianBot
        flags a potential parasocial relationship between a student and an AI
        chatbot. It prioritizes student well-being, open communication, and
        adherence to UK safeguarding standards.

        I. Immediate Actions & Teacher Responsibilities:
      </h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
        <li>
          <strong>Review the Alert:</strong> Understand the nature of the
          flagged interaction. Consider the frequency, duration, and emotional
          content of the student's communication with the chatbot.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Private Conversation:</strong> Arrange a private,
          non-judgmental conversation with the student.
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
            <li>
              <strong>Younger Students (5-9):</strong> "Who are your favourite
              people to talk to? Do you talk to anyone online? What do you like
              to talk about with them?"
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Older Students (10-15):</strong> "I've noticed you've been
              spending time talking with [chatbot name]. Can you tell me a bit
              about that?" "How do these online conversations make you feel?"
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Safeguarding Concerns:</strong> If the conversation reveals
          potential harm (e.g., emotional distress, vulnerability, inappropriate
          content), immediately inform the Designated Safeguarding Lead (DSL).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Documentation:</strong> Keep a confidential record of the
          conversation, including date, time, key observations, and any actions
          taken.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">
        II. Appropriate Escalation & Support Measures:
      </h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
        <li>
          <strong>Consult with DSL:</strong> The DSL will advise on further
          action, including potential involvement of external agencies (if
          necessary).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>School Counselor Referral:</strong> If the student exhibits
          emotional distress or social difficulties, refer them to the school
          counselor for support.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pastoral Support:</strong> Inform the student's Head of
          Year/Pastoral Lead to ensure a coordinated approach to supporting the
          student's well-being.
        </li>
      </ul>

              relationships, the limitations of AI, and the importance of
              balanced social interactions. Explain that chatbots cannot replace
              human connection.

            understands the difference between online interactions and real-life
